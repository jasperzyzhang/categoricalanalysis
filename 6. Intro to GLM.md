# Topic 6: Intro to GLM

###NOV11 MON

##Review:

1. **Coding in SAS**
   * Effect Coding 1 -1, Reference Coding Ref = first or Ref = Last
2. **Model Overfitting**
   * Too many variables relative to the sample size or number of events results in numerically unstable estimates.
3. **Multicollinearity**
   * Strong Linear dependencies among the explanatory vars
   * vars highly correlated to each other -> hard to estimate vars' distinct effects on some dependent vars
   * make coefficients unstable
4. **EPV less than 10**
   * Penalized regression(Ridge Regression,LASSO)
5. **Model Selection** 
   * Forward, Backward
   * p-value, AIC($j US-2 \times (maxloglike - numerof parameters)$)
   * simple model can be preffered b/c provide better estimates of certain characteristics
   * predictive power: c-index, ROC
6. **Model Validation**
   1. Calibration: agreement of observed out comes and predictions
   2. Discrimination: ability to disciminate b/t low/high risk patients

## Intro to GLM

1. **Restrictions of linear models**

   1. Y is restricted( eg. binary or counts)
   2. when var of Y depends on mean

2. All Models listed have the distn in the Exponential Dispersion Family

3. **limitations**

   1. Linear function
   2. Responses must be independent

4. **Components**

   1. random component
   2. Systematic component
   3. Link function
      1. g(mu) = mu called identity lnk
      2. Canonical Link: transform the mean to the natural parameter

5. GLM is a linear model for a transformed mean of a response variable that has a distribution in the natural exponential family.

6. $$f(y_i;\theta_i) = a(\theta_i)b(y_i)exp(y_iQ(\theta_i))$$ Qi : natural parameter

7. **Bernoulli**

   1. $$f = \pi^y (1-\pi)^{1-y}=(1-\pi) exp * y log(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi})$$

8. **Poisson**

   1. $$f = \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^y}{y!} = exp(-\mu) \frac{1}{y!}exp(ylog\mu)$$

9. **Transformation**

   1. Response var has changed
   2. transformation must simulateneously improve linearity and homogeneity of variance
   3. transformation may not be defined on the boundaries of the sample space
