# Topic 6: Intro to GLM

##Review:

1. **Coding in SAS**
   * Effect Coding 1 -1, Reference Coding Ref = first or Ref = Last
2. **Model Overfitting**
   * Too many variables relative to the sample size or number of events results in numerically unstable estimates.
3. **Multicollinearity**
   * Strong Linear dependencies among the explanatory vars
   * vars highly correlated to each other -> hard to estimate vars' distinct effects on some dependent vars
   * make coefficients unstable
4. **EPV less than 10**
   * Penalized regression(Ridge Regression,LASSO)
5. **Model Selection** 
   * Forward, Backward
   * p-value, AIC($-2 \times (maxloglike - numerof parameters)$)
   * simple model can be preffered b/c provide better estimates of certain characteristics
   * predictive power: c-index, ROC
6. **Model Validation**
   1. Calibration: agreement of observed out comes and predictions
   2. Discrimination: ability to disciminate b/t low/high risk patients
