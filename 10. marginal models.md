#Topic 10: Marginal Models for clustered responses

###Nov19

**Announcements**:  Final exam Dec.4th 2-5

Final Exam materials: Modeling

1. Binary logistic regression
2. generalized liinear models
3. multinomial logistic regression
4. proportional odds model
5. Log linear modeling
6. analysis of matched pairs
7. mariginal and conditional models for clustered data
8. need to be able to interpret SAS out from these types of model fits



## Clarifications

1. **overlapping CI question:** Do not overlap _ > result is statistically significant

2. **DF 60 **: Wrong

   1. \#  of parameters in the saturated model  = 64

   2. \# of parameters in the incercept only model = 4

   3. Devicance df = 64 -4 = 60

3. $$\lambda$$ in a log linear model
   1. LHS observed value  VS RHS model fitting value
   2. $$log\mu_{black, belief = Yes} = \lambda + \lambda^{RACE}_{black} + \lambda^{Belief}_{Yes}$$

## Review

## Marginal Models for clustered responses

1. correlated observations: the response variables is observed for matched sets of subjects: Clusters
   1. repeated measurement on subjects
   2. ususally positively correlated
   3. analyses ignore the correlation can estimate model parameters well but se estimators can be badly biased
2.
