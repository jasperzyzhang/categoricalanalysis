## Logit Models for Nomial Responses

1. **Categories**: J choose 2 in total, J - 1 non-redundant, others are redundant

   $$log\frac{\pi_j(x)}{\pi_J(x)} = \alpha_j + \beta^T_jx, j = 1...J-1$$

2. **Baseline-Category Logits**:
   1. $$log\frac{\pi_a(x)}{\pi_b(x)} = log\frac{\pi_a(x)}{\pi_J(x)} - log\frac{\pi_b(x)}{\pi_J(x)}$$
   2. $$\alpha_a -\alpha_b + (\beta_a - \beta_b)x$$
   3. each **comparison** has its own intercepts and beta coefficient, J = 2: ordinary logistic regression for binary responses
3. **Alligator food choice example**
   1. $$log(\pi_F/ \pi_O) = 1.618 - 0.11x$$
   2. $$log(\pi_I/ \pi_O) = 5.697 - 2.465x$$

4. **odds ratio** = $$e^\beta$$ estimated odds = $$e^\beta$$ times the estimated odds at length x
5.
