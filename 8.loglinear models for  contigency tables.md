# Topic 8: Log-Linear Models for Contigency Tables

### Nov27

## Questions to be solved

1. 


## Checking Goodness of Fit Grouped vs Ungrouped data

1. **Explanatory Vars are solely categorical** 
   1. residual df = number of paras in saturated model(number of setting s of x) - number of paras in the model
   2. Fixed number settings of predictor values is referred to as grouped data
2. **Explanatory vas are not solely categorical** (one can have continuous vars)
   1. Saturated Model: deviance does not necessarily follow a chi-square dist'n since the number of parameters is not fixed
   2. Ungrouped data, saturated model has a parameter for each subject

3. **Horseshoe crab data** if we group them
   1. Width has 66 unique values 66x2 contingency table
   2. Most fitted counts are very small
   3. when new data comes, additional with values would occur -> table dimension would grow( not fixed)



## Log-Linear Models for 2 way tables

1. GLM using log link with poisson response-> model contigency table
2. $$\pi_{ij} = \pi_{i+} \pi_{+j}$$ hence  $$\mu_{ij} = n\pi_{i+} \pi_{+j}$$
3. Loglinear Model of independence $$log\mu_{ij} = \lambda + \lambda_i^X + \lambda_j^Y$$ with row effect $$\lambda_i^X$$ and column effect $$\lambda_j^Y$$. Null Hypothesis of independence between two categorical variables is that model holds.
4. **I x 2 table**: 
   1. $$logit[P(Y = 1| X = i)] = log\frac{P(Y = 1| X = i)}{P(Y = 2| X = i)} = log\frac{\mu_{i1}}{\mu_{i2}} = log\mu_{i1} - log\mu_{i2} = (\lambda + \lambda_i^X + \lambda_1^Y) - (\lambda + \lambda_i^X + \lambda_2^Y) = \lambda_1^Y - \lambda_2^Y $$
   2.  final term does not depend on i -> logit P Y = 1 X = i is identical at each level of X ->$$logit [P (Y = 1 | X = i)] = \alpha$$
   3. Odds of response in col1 equal $$exp(\alpha) = exp(\lambda_1^Y - \lambda_2^Y)$$ eg belief Yes estimated 1.49, odds of belief in the afterlife is exp(1.49) = 4.5 for each race

5. Saturated Loglinear Model: $$log\mu_{ij} = \lambda + \lambda_i^X + \lambda_j^Y + \lambda_{ij}^{XY}$$
6. **Interpretation of Interaction**: $$log\theta = log (\mu_{11} \mu_{22} / mu_{12} \mu_{21})= \lambda_{11}^{XY} + \lambda_{22}^{XY} - \lambda_{12}^{XY} - \lambda_{21}^{XY}$$
